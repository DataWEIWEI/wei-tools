00:00:15,039 --> 00:17.45
You're stuck in the middle

8
00:00:17,449 --> 00:00:19,449
你被困在漩涡中心

9
00:00:17,449 --> 00:19.67
Of all irrelevance

10
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:21,670
内心在叫嚣

00:00:19,670 --> 00:21.96
And your heart is beating

12
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:23,960

00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:28,620
跳出这漩涡

17
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:28,620
And rise to the top now

18
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:30,140
远走高飞

19
00:00:28,140 --> 00:30.72
When you've made it

00:00:33,039 --> 00:37.75
Cause I'm playin' it all wrong

24
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:39,750

You can't fight the friction

32
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:52,420
冲突在所难免

33
00:00:50,420 --> 00:52.52
So ease it off

别说我该坚强
